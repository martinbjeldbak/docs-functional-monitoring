You can run a test before it is next scheduled to run. Doing so does not reset the schedule, which continues to run at previously set intervals.

== Before You Begin

Because you are running the test outside of a schedule, you must select the location for the test to run. If you want to use the same location that is used by the schedule, navigate to the monitor detail page and view the location of the schedule.

== Procedure

There are two different methods to run a test.

To run a test from the homepage:

. Hover over the test to run.
. Click *Run* (image:afm-ui-run-button.png[width=1%,height=1%]).
. Select the location and environment in which to run the test.
. Click *Run now*.

To run a test from its details page:

. Select the monitor that includes the test to run.
. Click the monitor.
. Click *Run* (image:afm-ui-run-button.png[width=1%,height=1%]).
. Select the location and environment in which to run the test.
. Click *Run now*.

== Result

The test runs immediately and the results are displayed. The current interval in the associated schedule continues to elapse.
