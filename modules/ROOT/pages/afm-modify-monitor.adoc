You can modify monitors via the Functional Monitoring UI, which includes the options to edit the monitor as text fields or to edit the monitor as BAT source. Additionally you can download the monitor as BAT source, edit the monitor in your text editor of choice, and then upload the monitor.

This procedure describes modifying monitors via the Functional Monitoring UI.

== Procedure

There are two methods to modify a monitor.

To modify a monitor from the homepage:

. Hover over the monitor to modify. 
. Click *Edit* (image:afm-ui-edit-button.png[width=1.5%,height=1.5%]).

To modify a monitor from its detail page:

. Select the monitor that you want to modify.
. Click the monitor.
. Tap *More* (image:afm-ui-more-button.png[width=0.75%,height=0.75%]) followed by *Edit*.

== Result

The following options appear:

* Tab one (*Step 1 - Select endpoints*) allows you to modify the endpoints.
** You can edit endpoint methods, URLs, optional headers, and assertions. Additionally, toggle *Validate SSL Certificate* to specify if the monitor needs to use self-signed certifications.

* Tab two (*Step 2 - Set notifications*) allows you to modify notifications.

Alernatively, select *Switch to code editor* to edit the monitor as BAT source. For more details, see xref:bat-bdd-reference.adoc[BDD Test-Writing Syntax Reference].
