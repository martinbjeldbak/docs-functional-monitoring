You can download a test and modify it on your computer. Then, you can either run the test by using the BAT CLI or upload the test into the online interface for API Functional Monitoring to create a new monitor.

If you are new to writing tests manually, you can download tests, see how they are structured, and view the content of the files. The knowledge you gain can help you write your own tests.

== Procedure

. Select the monitor to download.
. Click the monitor to enter the monitor detail page.
. Tap *More* (image:afm-ui-more-button.png[width=0.75%,height=0.75%]) followed by *Download Monitor* to download a monitor as BAT source.

== Result

The following file is downloaded:

* `<your Anypoint Platform group ID>_<the name of the monitor>_<the test version>.zip`.
