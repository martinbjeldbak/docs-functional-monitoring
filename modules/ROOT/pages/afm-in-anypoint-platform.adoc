API Functional Monitoring allows you to verify responses to requests sent to API resources at its endpoints. You monitor APIs by accessing the *Functional Monitoring* section of Anypoint Monitoring, which you select from the home page of Anypoint Platform. 

The *Functional Monitoring* section contains tools for creating and editing monitors. Additionally, you can upload custom test suites written in BAT, a Behavior Driven Development (BDD) language.

The following illustrates the components of a monitor:

.A monitor includes a test and a schedule for running the test.

Tests include:

* The endpoints to verify.
* Optional assertions to verify at the endpoints (for example, a 200 status code).
* Optional HTTP headers to include when sending requests to the endpoints.
* Optional tools used to send test reports. Examples include SumoLogic and Slack.

Test schedules include:

* The location from which to run the test.

Locations can be public or private. For details, see xref:afm-monitoring-public-apis.adoc[Monitoring the Endpoints of Public APIs] and xref:afm-monitoring-private-apis.adoc[Monitoring the Endpoints of Private APIs].
* The time interval to wait between tests.

You can create more than one schedule per monitor.

.Schedules are listed under *Next run*.
